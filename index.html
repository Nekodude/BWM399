            <h2>A little about myself.....</h2>
                <p>
                I was born in Pittsburgh, PA. I am an Army veteran. I served two tours in Iraq. Due to an injury I sustained in the line of duty I am no longer able to work in general labor and I decided to seek new employment through education. 
                </p>
                <p>
                	I am married, have 2 cats and I am looking to adopt a child after college. I have been a student at Pennsylvania College of Technology for 3 years and I am looking forward to graduating in 2 years.
